        <h2>  How to be a dog owner in immigration</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">Tell me I'm not the only one, please </p>
        <p>In September 2023, I left to study in another country and my family dog stayed at home in Brest.
            At first, during our conversations with him on the speakerphone, he reacted actively to my voice,
            sometimes he even ran around the flat looking for me. As time went on, he became weaker and weaker in his reactions,
            and now he doesn't even turn a deaf ear. When I arrive, it takes him a couple of days to accept the fact that
            I have arrived and that I can be taken seriously. </p>
        <p class="blog-post-meta"> He has a right to be offended, but it's still hearts ðŸ˜”</p>

        <div class="mb-1 text-body-secondary"> * I've always wanted to do a compilation of my favourite books so why not *</div>
        <h2>The best books in this world</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>J.k.Rowling "Harry Potter"</li> <p>Forever in my heart, especially the 5th book. If you don't like thees books, I don't know gays, you are muglles. Just 10/10 </p>
            <li>Cornelia Funke "Inkworld Trilogy"</li> <p>If you like fantasy, books, castles, magical animals this trilogy is 100% for you. You've never read anything like it. Just 10/10</p>
            <li>Stephen Hawking "The theory of everything"</li> <p> I have no worlds, for me this book was extremely interesting. I'm madly in love with astrophysics, so I can recommend it to similarly amateur astrophysicists. Also I can say that it is quite a difficult book if you start reading it without some knowledge of physics. Just 10.10 </p>
        </ul>
        <p>And this is an ordered list:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Hurry Potter</li>
            <li>The theory of everything</li>
            <li>Inkworld theory</li>
